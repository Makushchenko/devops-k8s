# Base64 Encoder for SDLC Steps

A simple Python script that converts each step of the Software Development Lifecycle (`plan`, `code`, `test`, `delivery`, `deploy`, `monitor`) into its Base64 representation. Useful for learning encoding techniques or integrating Base64-encoded data streams into automation workflows.

## Usage

```bash
python encode_sdlc_steps.py
```

Each step will be printed as a Base64-encoded byte string, for example:

```
b'cGxhbg=='
b'Y29kZQ=='
...
```
